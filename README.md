## Description

2048 is a classic puzzle game where the goal is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The game starts with two tiles numbered 2 or 4, and the player can move these tiles in four directions: up, down, left, or right. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one! The game ends when the grid is full and no more moves are possible.

This version of the game is optimized for laptops/desktops and may not be compatible with mobile or tablet devices.
